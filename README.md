# 100-Days-CSS-Challenge

Welcome to my 100-Days-CSS challenge! This is a personal project aimed at enhancing my CSS skills through consistent practice over the course of 100 days. Whether you're joining me on this journey or simply curious about what I'm up to, I'm excited to share my progress with you.

## What is the Challenge About?

The 100-Days-CSS challenge is all about dedicating time every day to work on CSS projects. Each day, I'll be coding something new with CSS, whether it's experimenting with layouts, creating animations, or diving into responsive design techniques. The goal is to push myself to learn something new and improve my CSS skills with each passing day.
